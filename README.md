ROOM SERVICE AT A HOTEL
For project 2 at my  SEI Bootcamp, I've been asked to build an app based on a database.
I have a friend that manages a hotel. I've asked him if he needs anything because I wanted to experience some "real" requirements.
My friend told me that during the covid, their dining room is close, and the room service dinner. Each customer has to fill a form, and it is a mess to deliver the information to the chef.
So I said to myself, I am going to solve this problem.

I dealt with two collections in my database: 
Room's data - room number, how many people, Last name.
Orders data- main dish, side, dessert,  and allergies or comments for the chef.
I reference the collections and give the customer the ability to order his dinner and edit it.
For the managing side, In the end, I created a list with all the data for the chef.

Thank you very much.
